    <p class="paragraph section-paragraph">In April 1994, members of Sakyadhita Hawai'i organized a four-day visit of His Holiness the Dalai Lama to Hawai'i, in conjuntion with the East-West Center, the Spark Matsunage Institute for Peace, the School of Hawaiian, Asian, and Pacific Studies of the University of Hawai'i , local Buddhist temples, and numerous community organizations.<br></p>
    <p class="paragraph section-paragraph">His Holiness the Dalai Lama developed his philosophy of peace from a great reverence for all living things and upon the concept of universal responsibility embracing all humankind as well as nature. In the words of the Noble Prize Committee, he has come forward with "constructive and forward-looking proposals for the solution of international conflicts, human rights issues, and global environmental problems." In 1993, he participated in the Centenary Parliament of World's Religions in Chicago and signed a declaration of universal religious harmony and understanding. He continues to work tirelessly to bring the message of peace to the world.<br></p>
    <p class="paragraph section-paragraph">From April 15 to 17, 1994, Sakyadhita Hawai'i organized a day-long seminar on "Local Identity in the Global Community" at the Hawai'i Prince Hotel, in cooperation with the East-West Center, the Spark M. Matsunaga Institute for Peace, and the School of Hawaiian, Asian, and Pacific Studies of the University of Hawai'i. In addition, we organized a public talk at the Waikiki Shell titled "Is a Non-Violent Society Possible?" and an interreligious dialogue program at Blaisdell Auditorium titled "Compassion for World Peace." To engage the local Hawaiian community, we organized a Ho'okupu ceremony at Iolani Palace. Altogether more than 7,000 people participated in these events. To reach out to the neighbor islands, we arranged for a talk on the Island of Hawai'i, held at Wood Valley Temple, that was attended by an estimated 1,000 people.<br></p>
    <p class="paragraph section-paragraph">To bring the insights of His Holiness the Dalai Lama to a wider audience, Sakyadhita Hawai'i undertook a project to produce a series of videos and an audio CD. The video programs were shown on Olelo, Hawai'i public television, numerous times over a period of years. An audio CD, titled “His Holiness the Dalai Lama in Hawai'i,” was produced by Edgy Lee with graphics designed by Daphne Chu. The audio CD combines the talks of His Holiness the Dalai Lama with classical Tibetan music and traditional folk songs. Sakyadhita Hawai'i has sold over 5000 copies of the CD, which is still available at www.amazon.com<br></p>
